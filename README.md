Project technical name: labtool2019

**Labtool** is a tool for grading programming projects at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki.

We have continued work which was started by the previous group (Software Engineering Project, TKT20007) during spring and early summer semesters, 2018. They rewrote the entire codebase of Labtool in `Node.js` and `React`. Previously `Ruby on Rails` was used.
